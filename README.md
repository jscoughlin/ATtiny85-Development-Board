# Arduino Compatible Development Board

![alt text](https://github.com/jscoughlin/ATtiny85-Development-Board/blob/master/Pictures/JSC151101A_Side.PNG)

I made this cute, lil' board for learning purposes. The board has a good mixture of thru-hole and surface mount components, making it a good board to get started with learning how to solder. Bonus: It can easily be programmed using Arduino!

The board has an ATtiny85 microcontroller with pins broken out for you to use. It also has a USB - mini B connector so that you can supply power to the board.

## Repository Organization
* BOM - Bill of Materials for the development board.
* Schematic - PDF of the schematic.
* PCB - Gerber files for this board.
* Pictures - Shots of the 3D model, in all its glory.

## How do I use Arduino with this?
I like using Sparkfun's Pocket AVR Programmer. This ATtiny85 dev board already has the ISP (in-system programmer) pins broken out for you to use. More information about how to use the Pocket AVR Programmer can be found [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pocket-avr-programmer-hookup-guide?_ga=1.69274392.948047713.1412741016).
